A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have. An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you are making a concrete instance of the class with specific values for its attributes. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to structure software. It focuses on grouping related data and functions together as objects, which helps organize code and make it modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
An abstract class OOP is used to define a blueprint for other classes. Unlike regular classes, abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, they serve as a template, allowing subclasses to inherit common attributes and methods but also requiring certain methods to be implemented by the subclasses.
superglobals are predefined variables that are available in all scopes throughout a PHP script. These variables hold data and are automatically populated by the PHP engine, providing easy access to information about the server, user input, session data, cookies, and more. Some examples are $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, $_SERVER. Superglobals make data handling and interaction between server, client, and user input straightforward and efficient in PHP applications.
Step 1 is to define the class within a namespace. In a PHP file, define the class and specify the namespace at the top of the file. This organizes the class and avoids name collisions with other classes that might have the same name. Step 2 is to import and use the class. To use the class from the namespace, you need to import it with the use keyword in the file where you want to use the class, or by referring to it with its full path.
MVC is a design pattern commonly used in web development to separate an application into three interconnected components. This separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain, test, and scale. The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. The View is the presentation layer, responsible for rendering the user interface. The Controller is the intermediary that handles user input, processes it, and coordinates between the Model and the View.
