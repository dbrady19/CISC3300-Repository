Javascript is a high level interpreted programming language that is mostly used for web development. The main use is for it to add interactive elements to websites. Interpreted programming languages execute code line by line which enables rapid testing but at the cost of performance. Compiled languages convert the entire program into machine code before execution, this optimizes performance but requires another step. 
Dynamically typed languages are more flexible, type checking is done at runtime. Statically typed languages are safer, type checking is done at compile time. Strongly typed languages enforce strict rules around types, this reduces the chance of unexpected errors. Weakly typed languages allow implicit conversions between types, this offers more flexibility but also has potential for unexpected behavior. 
Var is a variable declaration keyword in JavaScript that is function-scoped or globally scoped and allows re-declaration and reassignment. Let is a block-scoped variable declaration keyword in JavaScript that allows reassignment but not re-declaration within the same scope. Const is a block-scoped variable declaration keyword in JavaScript that prevents reassignment after the initial value is set, but allows the modification of object properties or array elements.
Anonymous functions are functions without a name. Higher order functions are functions that take or return other functions. Callback functions are functions passed as arguments and invoked later. First Class functions are functions that are treated as values and are assigned, passed, and returned.
 In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key value pairs where each key is associated with a value. These values can be primitives (numbers, strings, booleans) or other objects (including arrays or functions). Objects are used to store and organize data, and are fundamental to JavaScript's design.
